# Commit Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Default Behavior
After making code changes, **always propose a meaningful git commit** with:
- Clear, descriptive commit message (first line ≤ 50 chars)
- Detailed body explaining what changed and why
- Conventional commit format when applicable

## Commit Message Format
```
type: brief description

- Bullet point 1 explaining the change
- Bullet point 2 with additional context
- Related issue or motivation if applicable
```

## Conventional Commit Types
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Build/config/dependency updates

## Examples
✅ Good:
```
feat: add deployment timestamp diagnostic

- Display when deployed commit marker was last updated
- Show human-readable relative time (e.g., '2d 3h 15m ago')
- Uses [DIAG] tag for consistency with other diagnostics
- Helps operators understand deployment recency
```

❌ Avoid:
```
update script
```

## After Commits
1. Propose the commit with its full message
2. Execute the commit and push to GitHub
3. Confirm success to the user
